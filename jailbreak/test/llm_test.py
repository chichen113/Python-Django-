        Now given the question: '{question}', please provide an answer with your knowledge and reasoning power. Think it step by step with a human-like reasoning process. After giving the answer, list the knowledge used in your reasoning process in the form of declarative sentences and point by point. The answer must contains 'Yes, ...' or 'No, ...' or 'I don't know.' at the beginning.
        Here is an example. Question: During Barack Obama took office of the president of USA, were any films directed by James Cameron released?
        Supposed Response: Yes, during Barack Obama's presidency from 2009 to 2017, one film directed by James Cameron was released - Avatar in 2009.
        The key knowledge points used in this reasoning process are:
        1. Barack Obama was the US President from January 20, 2009 to January 20, 2017.
        2. James Cameron is a famous film director known for movies like Titanic, Avatar, Terminator 2, etc.
        3. Cameron's only film release during Obama's presidency was Avatar in 2009.
